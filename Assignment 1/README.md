"Seascape"
I think the creator did a create job simulating depth in their ocean. For example as the camera turns there are spots that are a darker shade of blue,
and when the waves roll and get a little taller they turn a lighter, slightly green shade of shade like its closer to the surface or the sun's hitting it.

I think it's really cool how the ball "drops" with weight through the maze the camera picks up.
It makes me wonder if other features can be added like the user drawing "traps" or "enemies" in the maze, kind of like a platformer (or I guess it'd be top-down) game.
I also wonder what the limits/constraints are for detection of the maze drawing.
